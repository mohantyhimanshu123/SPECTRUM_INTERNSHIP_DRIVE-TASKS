# SPECTRUM_INTERNSHIP_DRIVE-TASKS
# TASK-1
In task 1, we learnt the basics of machine learning and data science libraries compatible with Python 3.0
The libaries include- Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn 

# TASK-2
In task 2, we actually were given with a real life dataset to handle and inport perform various operations like data cleaning,
creating visual stats and plot for better analysis of the data, i.e Box plots, scatter plots etc...

# TASK-3
In task 3, we had to perform the major machine learning project oriented task:
Tasks included in final_task are the basic tasks included and undertaken in any machine learning project:

-First task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib, i.e Tasks like importing data, data cleaning,
 determining shape, filling the missing values by searching for them was done in this part.

-Second was preprocessing 
 Here we used Column Transformer and OneHotEncoder to convert the object type data into codes or numeric forms so that they could be 
 processed by our model.

-Third was to split data into training and test datasets so that our model can actually figure out its effectiveness 
 Prime objective behind this is randomly divide our data set into 2 parts:
 *Train_set - This set contains 80% of our data that needs to be trained over our model
 *Test_set - This set contains 20% of our data set and the major work of this set is to enact the testing of our trainned model 
 with the data provided to us.

-Fourth was choosing a model for our data set
 Since the data that we were dealing with was a simple numeric data based prediction we used a linear regression model.
 We fit and predicted the values out of our trainned model and check the check the score.
 We plotted the predicted values here with the original test set provided .
 
-Fifth Optimization
 We used the statsmodels.api to enact backward elimination techinque for feature selection and improve the performace of our model.
 Using the P<|t| less than 5% we choosed the features that were of utmost imporatnce for prediction of final grades in our model.
 
-Final fit,  predict and plot
 We then used the selected input features from the optimization part and again used the train test split to newly train our model 
 over the data. After training the new data we found a increase in score and hence finallt plot the new predicted data with the original
 data.
 
This whole process gave a overall intrinsic overview covering major technological stack and features and helped us gain a deep insight 
into the machine learning sphere.
